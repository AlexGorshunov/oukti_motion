# About the #uOKtiMotion Project
## Purpose
We want to check the theory that the informal collaboration of people inside our developers team will increase the team performance.

The purpose of the My #uOKtiMotion app is to collect Instagram photos with hashtag #uokti, that showcase us with whom our colleagues spend their free time on work. We do this by encouraging our team members to add the #uOKti hashtag to their photos every time when they going somewhere during worktime. This allows us to centrally collect and add these photos to our Elasticsearch data servers. It also allows us to analyse them and create a patterns of communication to increase a team collaboration.

## #uOKtiMotion Project idea in brief
Why do some teams comsistently deviver high performance while other, seemingly identical teams struggle? We are hoping to decode the "IT factor" that made groups click and we find that the most important predictor  of a team's  success is its communication patterns. Those patterns were as significant as all others factors - intelligence, personality, talent - combined. In fact we could foretell which teams would outperform simply by looking at the data on their communication.
