# About the My #uOKtiMotion Project
## Purpose
We want to check the theory that the informal collaboration of people inside our developers team will increase the team performance.

The purpose of the My #uOKtiMotion app is to collect Instagram photos with hashtag #uokti, that showcase us with whom our colleagues spend their free time on work. We do this by encouraging our team members to add the #uOKti hashtag to their photos every time when they going somewhere during worktime. This allows us to centrally collect and add these photos to our Elasticsearch data servers. It also allows us to analyse them and create a process to increase a team collaboration.

## Archiving the My #NCSULibrary Story
Social media plays a crucial role in documenting the unique cultural history of our institution. For that reason we are working to include relevant social media items in our University archives. All approved images tagged #NCSULibray will be included in the official North Carolina State University archives. Images selected for inclusion in the archives will be harvested by NCSU Libraries so that the archival digital object will reside on permanent NCSU Libraries storage infrastructure and not on Instagram servers.
