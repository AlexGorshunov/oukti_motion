# Privacy Policy

## Removal of Images
Users may contact UOKTI Motion at any time to request that the image be removed from our collections. Requesting that the photo be removed will remove it from both the My UOKTI Motion site as well as the university archives. If you have posted a photo that you would like removed simply send an email to tdstoffe@ncsu.edu with your Instagram username and we will remove your images from our collections.

## Terms of Use
The public is encouraged to contribute to My #NCSULibrary often by tagging multiple Instagram photos with the hashtag #NCSULibrary.

Popular images are determined by a combination of a photographâ€™s battle wins and the "likes" on the photograph. "Likes" on Instagram do not count towards the popularity score. "Likes" have to be submitted on the My #NCSULibrary app to affect the popularity ranking.

The photograph must obey all laws, including applicable copyright and privacy laws.

## Contact
If you have questions about the My #NCSULibrary project, please email tdstoffe@ncsu.edu
